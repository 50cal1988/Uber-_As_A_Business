**Uber Driver as a Business**

  In the era of Information Technology, the phrase, &quot;to take an Uber,&quot; has replaced the phrase, &quot;to take a cab.&quot; Uber has undoubtedly displaced the taxi industry, but the company didn&#39;t do it alone. If every Uber Driver were to quit right now, the company would immediately collapse, or at least until autonomous vehicle technology came along. Here are some interesting facts from muchneeded.com: Uber has 75 million riders and 3 million drivers globally, Uber net annual revenue in Q2 2018 was $2.7 billion and an Uber Driver earns an average income of about $364/month.

  There is a lot of money going around so how big is the piece of the pie Drivers take home? If you are interested in becoming a full time Driver you will essentially become self-employed. My application, with the Driver&#39;s data input, will calculate net income and be as easily readable as if you were reading a paycheck stub from an employer. The calculation is carried out by evaluating all the Driver&#39;s expenses and the man hours behind the wheel.

  There are many car expenses but let us start with the main one, ye old tank fill-ups. How gas efficient is your vehicle? If you are driving Uber as a serious business, you need the most fuel efficient you can find because gas Is the second most expensive cost after car purchase. Or maybe you want to use an electric vehicle; charging it is still an expense. Every gas fill-up/battery charge will be an important event because the Driver will be recording various pieces of information.

**Tank fill-ups:**
- Vehicle odometer (required)
- Gallons of gasoline (required)
- Price per gallon (required)
- Total cost (optional)
- Date/Time of event (required)
- Driver will upload a picture of the receipt (optional)

**Battery charge:**
- Vehicle odometer (required)
- Electricity rate (required)
- Duration of charging (required)
- Date/Time of event (required) (the moment the car stopped charging)

All vehicle expenses will be recorded by the driver and will be tallied into monthly tables.
**Expenses:** (Date of expense paid; total amount paid)
- Maintenance and repairs, including tire and oil changes.
- Car Insurance
- Vehicle registration fees
- Cell phone bill
- Lease payments
- Depreciation
- Car washes
- Business-related parking fees
- Tolls, if not paid by the passenger
- Miscellaneous Expenses

  Uber records the miles and the duration of transporting passengers. What Uber does not record is the distance and time the Driver spends looking for passengers. Uber also does not record the distance traveled to the pickup location and time spent from the moment the Driver accepts the passenger. The meter does not start running until the passenger enters the car. The unrecorded information is also important because it is an expense and man-hours. Man-hours is the most important factor, yet it not considered by Uber nor the IRS. You can earn so much money but how much work does it take?

**Distance and Time:**
- Date, Miles, and Hours driving passengers, entry (required, obtained from Uber app)
- Odometer, Date, and Time started driving (required)
- Odometer, Date, and Time stopped driving (required)

There will be a table to enter and display income. (Display total monthly income)
